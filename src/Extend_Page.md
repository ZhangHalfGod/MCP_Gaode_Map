AI 页面滚动交互效果描述词（暗黑色新页面版）
适用于 MidJourney、 Stable Diffusion 等 AI 绘图工具，可根据需求选择「简洁版」或「细节增强版」，支持搭配设计风格关键词调整视觉呈现。
一、基础通用版（核心需求优先）
UI design of a digital webpage, when the user scrolls the mouse wheel to the bottom of the current page, a new page automatically loads and appears smoothly; the new page has an all-over dark black color scheme (RGB reference: 15,15,15 to 30,30,30), with clear visual hierarchy between the old and new pages (no overlapping, smooth transition); the new page retains basic interface elements (e.g., minimalist navigation bar, subtle text placeholder) that match the dark tone, no redundant decorations, focusing on the "scroll-to-load dark page" interaction logic; clean lines, flat design style, high readability.
二、细节增强版（含交互 / 视觉氛围）
场景与载体：Desktop webpage interface (1920×1080 resolution), designed for content platforms (e.g., blog, news, product showcase), with a light-toned initial page (e.g., off-white #F5F5F5 background) to form a strong contrast with the new page.
核心交互：Realistic scroll interaction — when the mouse scrolls to the bottom of the initial page (scrollbar hits the bottom edge), the new page slides upward from the bottom of the screen (transition duration: 0.5s, no lag) and fully covers the viewport; during the transition, there is a subtle "fade-in" effect on the new page (opacity from 0 to 100%) to avoid abruptness.
新页面设计：
Color: Pure dark black base (hex #121212), with subtle dark gray (hex #2D2D2D) details for button borders or text highlights (no bright colors, maintaining a low-saturation dark atmosphere).
Elements: Minimalist layout — top has a thin dark gray navigation bar (2px height), middle area has 2-3 lines of placeholder text (light gray #AAAAAA, 16px font size), bottom has a small "back to top" icon (white #FFFFFF, semi-transparent when idle).
Texture: Subtle matte texture on the new page background (no glossy reflection), enhancing the sense of depth without affecting readability.
整体风格：Modern minimalist, UI/UX design focus, realistic light and shadow (soft ambient light on the new page edges), no extra graphics, highlighting the interaction process of "scroll to bottom → load dark page".
三、风格拓展关键词（可自由搭配）
科技风：Add "futuristic UI, neon blue (hex #00BFFF) thin border on new page, subtle grid lines in dark background"
极简风：Add "minimalist extreme, no navigation bar on new page, only center-aligned text, 0% shadow"
复古风：Add "vintage digital aesthetic, dark black page with slight brown tint (hex #1A1816), pixel-perfect text"
移动端适配：Modify to "Mobile webpage (375×812 resolution), touch scroll to bottom, new dark black page loads, with mobile-friendly large buttons"
